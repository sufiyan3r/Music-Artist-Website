My Portfolio Projects

This file contains my academic university project which consisted me of making a dynamic website based on my favourite music artist.
This file has used languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and has been made on Visual Studio Code.
The music website consists of 3 pages:
1, main home page which displays artists latest releases and brief description, artists reviews by popular publishers/daily newspapers/companies,
2, music page consisting of the artists latest music album and single releases with the support of a newsletter signup link at the bottom
3, sign up page for those interest in keeping up with the latest news about, the artist music updates/releases, concert/event details and newsletter.
